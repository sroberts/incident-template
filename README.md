# Investigation Template

## Setting Up

Well you'll need a few things to get started:

- Setup a python3 virtualenv: `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
- Start up that cool new virtualenv `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install a few dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Cool, you're good to go! Now you get going with the real stuff:

`python3 investigation.py`

Now you can get started investigating!
